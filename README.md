# Choose-your-adventure
This is a beginner level console application to allow a user to choose their own options for their adventure, taking user input tailoring the responses to each answer using conditional logic. 
This project was created to practice and demonstrate:
- User input handling
- Conditional statements
- String manipulation
- Basic program flow in C#

# How this works
The user enters their name.
A story is presented to them.
The user makes choices based on what is presented (answers such as YES/NO, 1, 2 or 3).
Each choice leads to a different outcome.

# Lessons learnt
This project was insightful in managing readable code. I had a couple issues with making sure that options were nested appropriately, causing additional options to appear after the user had ended their adventure. It took me time to go back through and make sure that the options that caused the adventure to end were not then followed by an innapropriate next step.
